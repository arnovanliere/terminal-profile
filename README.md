# Pixegami Terminal Profile

![terminal](./terminal_screenshot.png)

This is my profile for UNIX (MacOS/Linux) terminals. For Ubuntu, I just use the default terminal
app. For MacOS, I use [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com/).

> In the MacOS case, I have successfully installed this theme once before, but most of the terminal commands
> will be different. You'll just have to open the `.sh` files and figure out how to adapt it to MacOS
> until I can prepare MacOS commands.

These commands were last tested on May 2022 on Ubuntu 20.

# Prerequisites

For the scripts to work, I think these are the bare minimum requirements.

```bash
# Update your software repositories.
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade

# Install Git.
sudo apt-get install -y git

# Install Vim.
sudo apt-get install -y vim
```

# Installation

### Fira Code

Install Fira Code which is used in the terminal theme.

```bash
sudo apt install fonts-firacode
```

### ZSH, OhMyZSH and Plugins

The shell that I use is "ZSH", with the OhMyZSH upgrade on top of that. To install all of that stuff,
you can run the helper script (and may need to restart after).

```bash
./install_terminal.sh
```

After this, the terminal should look a bit different, but we need to do the next step to have the
entire theme.

### Profile (plugins, theme, font and color)

This script will first install two plugins that I like to use: auto-complete and color highlighting.

```bash
# You don't need to execute this - it's part of the script already.
(cd ~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/plugins && git clone https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting)
(cd ~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/plugins && git clone https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions)
```

It will also copy over the `.zshrc` and `pixegami-agnoster.zsh-theme` files for the
terminal to use (which will wire up the plugins and the theme).

The last command is to create a terminal profile that will set the colors and also set the font
to be the Fira Code one we installed earlier (required for the theme to display correctly).

```bash
./install_profile.sh
```
